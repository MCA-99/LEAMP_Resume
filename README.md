# LEAMP-Resume
This project seeks to easily create a web application capable of processing requests quickly and efficiently using Docker.

## Whatâ€™s a LEAMP stack?
LEMP refers to a collection of open-source software that is commonly used together to serve web applications. The term LEMP is an acronym that represents the configuration of a Linux operating system with an nginx (pronounced engine-x, hence the E in the acronym) web server, with site data stored in a MySQL database and dynamic content processed by PHP.

LEAMP is the same but with Angular addition.
